* Online courses, challenges and creation of my own projects.

## What I learned/used 
### HTML
* Hyper Text Markup Language
    * Annotates content
    * defines document structure
    * right and wrong syntax
    * 3 core web technologies
        * HTML, CSS, JavaScript
    * HTML History
    * tags Anatomy
        * open and close <p></p>
        * only open tag <br> <hr> self closing tag
        * attributes
            * id="myId" // unique
            * class="myId" //not unique
    * content Models
        * block-level Elements / flow content
        * Inline Elements / Phrasing content
    * Semantic tags
        * h1 - h6 -> <h1> is the most important and <h6> is the least important
        * //semantic elements do allow you for more meaningful expression of the structure of your HTML code, HTML page,but they don't really give you any more functionality than a regular div or regular span would without it
    * Lists
        * ul = unordered list
        * ol = ordered list
        * li = list Item
    * HTML Character Entity References
        * instead of < use &lt;
        * instead of > use &gt;
        * instead of & use &amp;
        * &copy; copyright
        * &nbsp; no space between the words
        * &quot; " for use quotes "
    * Creating Links        
        * internal links
            * <a href:"blabla.html"> //a tag is a inline and block line element
            * section
                <a href="#idName">
        * external links
            <a href:"http://blabla.com">
            * target = "_blank" //open in a new window

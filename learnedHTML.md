## What I learned/used 
### HTML
* Hyper Text Markup Language
    * Annotates content
    * defines document structure
    * right and wrong syntax
    * 3 core web technologies
        * HTML, CSS, JavaScript
    * HTML History
    * tags Anatomy
        * open and close <p></p>
        * only open tag <br> <hr> self closing tag
        * attributes
            * id="myId" // unique
            * class="myId" //not unique
    * content Models
        * block-level Elements / flow content
        * Inline Elements / Phrasing content
    * Semantic tags
        * h1 - h6 -> <h1> is the most important and <h6> is the least important
        * //semantic elements do allow you formore meaningful expression of the structure of your HTML code, HTML page,but they don't really give you any more functionality than a regular div orregular span would without it
